# Hierarchical Multi-Agent Traffic Signal Coordination and Control

## Description
This project implements a **hierarchical traffic signal control framework** for urban corridors, combining **model-based optimization** and **reinforcement learning** in a SUMO–Ray RLlib environment.

Architecture:
1. **High-Level Coordinator (HLC)** – selects Max-Flow Coordination (MFC) or Green-Wave Coordination (GWC) based on traffic demand.
2. **Corridor Coordinator** – converts the selected strategy into signal phase constraints.
3. **Hybrid Signal Agents (HSAs)** – RL agents control intersections with action masking for feasibility.

Training:
- **Low-level HSAs**: MFC-aware, GWC-aware, or Pure Agent Control (PAC).
- **High-level HLC**: dynamically switches strategies to balance corridor-level and network-wide performance.

## Features
- Hierarchical multi-agent control
- Multiple signal coordination strategies (MFC, GWC, PAC)
- Multi-agent PPO training with RLlib
- SUMO integration (GUI or headless)
